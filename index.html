        The Unicorn
      </h1>
      <p>
        The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as
        a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.
        The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization and
        was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various
        writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian and Cosmas
        Indicopleustes.The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some
        versions translate as unicorn.
      </p>
      <p>
        In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse-like or
        goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard).
        In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely
        wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured
        only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to
        render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and
        Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.

        Unicorns in Chinese mythology
      </h2>
      <p>
        The qilin (Chinese: 麒麟), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes called
        "the Chinese unicorn", and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its
        defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a hybrid animal
        that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, the head of a lion,
        green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese version (kirin) more
        closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese
        qilin. The Quẻ Ly of Vietnamese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated "unicorn"
        is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the
        Duong Dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory
        which resulted in his conquest of Tây Nguyên. In November 2012 the History
        Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the Korea News
        Service, reported that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with a
        kirin ridden by King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.

        Beginning in the Ming Dynasty, the qilin became associated with giraffes,
        after Zheng He's voyage to East Africa brought a pair of the long-necked
        animals and introduced them at court in Nanjing as qilin. The resemblance to
        the qilin was noted in the giraffe's ossicones (bony protrusions from the
        skull resembling horns), graceful movements, and peaceful demeanor.
        Shanhaijing (117) also mentioned Bo-horse (Chinese: 駮馬; pinyin: bómǎ), a
        chimera horse with ox tail, single horn, white body, and its sound like person
        calling. The creature is lived at Honest-head Mountain. Guo Pu in his jiangfu
        said that Bo-horse able to walk on water. Another similar creature also
        mentioned in Shanhaijing (80) to live in Mount Winding-Centre as Bo (Chinese:
        駮; pinyin: bó), but with black tail, tiger's teeth and claws, and also devour
        leopards and tigers.
